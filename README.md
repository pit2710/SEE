# SEE (Software Engineering Experience)

[![Tests](https://github.com/uni-bremen-agst/SEE/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/uni-bremen-agst/SEE/actions/workflows/main.yml)

SEE visualizes hierarchical dependency graphs of software in 3D/VR based on the code-city metaphor. Code cities are presented in virtual rooms where members of distributed software development teams can meet to discuss issues about their software at a higher level of abstraction. They can not only see and interact with the code cities independently but also communicate (voice and gestures) with other present team members represented as avatars. Team members can enter the virtual room from anywhere and with different kinds of devices, i.e., traditional desktop computers with monitor, mouse, and keyboard as well as VR hardware.

The underlying game engine is Unity 3D (version 2022.3.26f1).
